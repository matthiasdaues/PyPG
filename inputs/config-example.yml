policies:
    # The policies follow a role based access control pattern.
    # Per schema there exist three access tiers:
    # "all" = ALL privileges within schema are granted
    # "use" = CRUD privileges on table content are granted
    # "r"   = SELECT privileges on table content are granted
    # The respective access rights are configured to each user
    # patterned like this: 
    # user 
    #   schema_1: tier_1
    #   schema_2: etc...
    #
    user_1:
        schema_1: all
        schema_2: use
        schema_3: r
    user_2:
        schema_1: r
        schema_2: all
        schema_3: use
    user_3:
        schema_1: use
        schema_2: r
        schema_3: all
