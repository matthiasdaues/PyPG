    # "r"   = SELECT privileges on table content are granted
    # The respective access rights are granted to each user
    # patterned like this: schema: tier

    # Define here which user (grantee) needs to be able to grant 
    # ownership to the replication user by assigning it the
    # the replication user role (user_role):

    # grantee: user_role
